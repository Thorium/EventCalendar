FunScript uses F#-language, FSharp.Data. It has strongly typed libraries via TypeScript)\r\n - The compiled version is available at demo-folder.\r\n\r\nThe runtime uses pure HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript with jQuery, jQuery-UI and Modernizer\r\n\r\nSoftware features:\r\n------\r\n- Event list\r\n- HTML5-Geolocation to find nearest events\r\n- QR-Code generation: Get event details to your phone notification.\r\n- Google maps to display locations of events\r\n- Event calendar to show dates that has events (just JQuery datepicker)\r\n- Ability to fetch Longitude/Latitude of items (not in UI)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n------\r\n\r\n- If you have over 2000 visitors per day, I suppose Google will want something for using their APIs (Map, QR-code)\r\n- I have tested this only with Internet Explorer 10, FireFox 20 and Chrome 26. \r\n- The data is in HTML-file, so it should be available even when disabled JavaScript (+CSS) (/ Lynx).\r\n- There is not yet implementation of any way to fetch events: Now they are just JavaScript objects.\r\n  I'm planning to make a PHP-page to generate the data (fetch from somewhere).\r\n- I will support Finnish UI, maybe also English... ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat this is not:\r\n------\r\n\r\n- This is not generic user control. No Flash. No Silverlight. Not this time.\r\n- Direct plugin of some CMS system. But with light modifications you may use it as one...\r\n- This is not registration/enrollment-system, advertisement-system or news/RSS-source. Social media does that better.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://raw.github.com/Thorium/EventCalendar/master/demo/demo.jpg\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
